# Multi-cluster communication with Flomesh Service Mesh

Kubernetes has been quite successful in popularizing the idea of ​​container clusters. Deployments have reached a point where many users are running multiple clusters and struggling to keep them running smoothly. Organizations need to run multiple Kubernetes clusters might fall into one of the below reasons (not an exhaustive list):

* Location
  * Latency (run the application as close to customers as possible)
  * Jurisdiction (e.g. required to keep user data in-country)
  * Data gravity (e.g. data exists in one provider)
* Isolation
  * Environment (e.g. development, testing, staging, prod, etc)
  * Performance isolation (teams don't want to feel each other)
  * Security isolation (sensitive data or untrusted code)
  * Organizational isolation (teams have different management domains)
  * Cost isolation (teams want to get different bills)
* Reliability
  * Blast radius (an infra or app problem in one cluster doesn't kill the whole system)
  * Infrastructure diversity (an underlying zone, region, or provider outages does not bring down the whole system)
  * Scale (the app is too big to fit in a single cluster)
  * Upgrade scope (upgrade infra for some parts of your app but not all of it; avoid the need for in-place cluster upgrades)

There is currently no standard way to connect or even think about Kubernetes services beyond the single cluster boundary, and Kubernetes Multicluster SIG has put together a proposal [KEP-1645](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/1645-multi-cluster-services-api) to extend Kubernetes Service concepts across multiple clusters.

[Flomesh](https://flomesh.io) team has been spending time tackling the challenge of multicluster communication, integrating north-south traffic management capabilities into [FSM](https://flomesh.io/fsm) SMI compatible service mesh, and contributing back to the Open Source community.

In this part of the series, we will be looking into motivation, goals, architecture of [FSM](https://github.com/flomesh-io/fsm) multi-cluster support, its components.


### Motivation

During our consultancy and support to the community, commercial clients, and enterprises we have seen multiple requests and desires (a few of which are cited above) on why they want to split their deployments across multiple clusters while maintaining mutual dependencies between workloads operating in those clusters. Currently, the cluster is a hard boundary, and service is opaque to a distant K8s consumer who may otherwise use metadata (e.g. endpoint topology) to better direct traffic. Users may want to use services distributed across clusters to support failover or temporarily during migration, however, this needs non-trivial customized solutions today.

Flomesh team aims to help the community by providing solutions to these problems.

### Goals

* Define a minimal API to support service discovery and consumption across clusters.
  * Consume a service in another cluster.
  * Consume a service deployed in multiple clusters as a single service.
* When a service is consumed from another cluster its behavior should be predictable and consistent with how it would be consumed within its cluster.
* Allow gradual rollout of changes in a multi-cluster environment.
* Provide a stand-alone implementation that can be used without any coupling to any product and/or solution.
* Transparent integration with [FSM](https://flomesh.io/fsm) service mesh, for users who want to have multi-cluster support with service mesh functionality.
* Fully open source and welcomes the community to participate and contribute.

### Architecture

FSM provides a set of Kubernetes custom resources (CRD) for cluster connector, and make use of [KEP-1645](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/1645-multi-cluster-services-api) `ServiceExport` and `ServiceImport` API for exporting and importing services. So let's take a quick look at them

### `Cluster` CRD

When registering a cluster, we provide the following information.

- The address (e.g. `gatewayHost: cluster-A.host`) and port (e.g. `gatewayPort: 80`) of the cluster
- `kubeconfig` to access the cluster, containing the api-server address and information such as the certificate and secret key

```yaml
apiVersion: flomesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-A
spec:
  gatewayHost: cluster-A.host
  gatewayPort: 80
  kubeconfig: |+
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
    - cluster:
        certificate-authority-data:
        server: https://cluster-A.host:6443
      name: cluster-A
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: cluster-A
        user: admin@cluster-A
      name: cluster-A
    current-context: cluster-A
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - name: admin@cluster-A
      user:
        client-certificate-data:
        client-key-data:
```

### `ServiceExport` and `ServiceImport` CRD

For cross-cluster service registration, FSM provides the `ServiceExport` and `ServiceImport` CRDs from [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-multicluster/1645-multi-cluster-services-api) for `ServiceExports.flomesh.io` and `ServiceImports.flomesh.io`. The former is used to register services with the control plane and declare that the application can provide services across clusters, while the latter is used to reference services from other clusters. 

For clusters `cluster-A` and `cluster-B` that join the cluster federation, a `Service` named `foo` exists under the namespace `bar` of cluster `cluster-A` and a `ServiceExport` `foo` of the same name is created under the same namespace. A `ServiceImport` resource with the same name is automatically created under the namespace `bar` of cluster `cluster-B` (if it does not exist, it is automatically created).

```yaml
// in cluster-A
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: bar
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: foo
---
apiVersion: flomesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceExport
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: bar
---
// in cluster-B
apiVersion: flomesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceImport
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: bar
```

The YAML snippet above shows how to register the `foo` service to the control plane of a multi-cluster. In the following, we will walk through a slightly more complex scenario of cross-cluster service registration and traffic scheduling.

Okay that was a quick introduction to the CRDs, so let's continue with our demo.
