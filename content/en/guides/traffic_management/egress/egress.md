## Allowing access to the Internet and out-of-mesh services (Egress)

This document describes the steps required to enable access to the Internet and services external to the service mesh, referred to as `Egress` traffic.

FSM redirects all outbound traffic from a pod within the mesh to the pod's sidecar proxy. Outbound traffic can be classified into two categories:

1. Traffic to services within the mesh cluster, referred to as in-mesh traffic
2. Traffic to services external to the mesh cluster, referred to as egress traffic

While in-mesh traffic is routed based on L7 traffic policies, egress traffic is routed differently and is not subject to in-mesh traffic policies. FSM supports access to external services as a passthrough without subjecting such traffic to filtering policies.

## Configuring Egress

There are two mechanisms to configure Egress:

1. Using the Egress policy API: to provide fine grained access control over external traffic
2. Using the mesh-wide global egress passthrough setting: the setting is toggled on or off and affects all pods in the mesh, enabling which allows traffic destined to destinations outside the mesh to egress the pod.

## 1. Configuring Egress policies

FSM supports configuring fine grained policies for traffic destined to external endpoints using its [Egress policy API](/api_reference/policy/v1alpha1/#policy.flomesh.io/v1alpha1.EgressSpec). To use this feature, enable it if not enabled:

```bash
# Replace fsm-system with the namespace where FSM is installed
kubectl patch meshconfig fsm-mesh-config -n fsm-system -p '{"spec":{"featureFlags":{"enableEgressPolicy":true},"traffic":{"enableEgress":false}}}' --type=merge
```

> Remember to disable egress passthrough with set `traffic.enableEgress: false`.

Refer to the [Egress policy demo](/demos/egress/egress_policy) and [API documentation](/api_reference/policy/v1alpha1/#policy.flomesh.io/v1alpha1.EgressSpec) on how to configure policies for routing egress traffic for various protocols.

## 2. Configuring mesh-wide Egress passthrough

### Enabling mesh-wide Egress passthrough to external destinations

Egress can be enabled mesh-wide during FSM install or post install. When egress is enabled mesh-wide, outbound traffic from pods are allowed to egress the pod as long as the traffic does not match in-mesh traffic policies that otherwise deny the traffic.

1. During FSM installation, the egress feature is **enabled by default**. You can disabled via options as below.

   ```bash
   fsm install --set fsm.enableEgress=false
   ```

2. After FSM has been installed:

   `fsm-controller` retrieves the egress configuration from the `fsm-mesh-config` `MeshConfig` custom resource in the fsm mesh control plane namespace (`fsm-system` by default). Use `kubectl patch` to set `enableEgress` to `true` in the `fsm-mesh-config` resource.

   ```bash
   # Replace fsm-system with the namespace where FSM is installed
   kubectl patch meshconfig fsm-mesh-config -n fsm-system -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"enableEgress":true}}}' --type=merge
   ```

   > With kubectl patching, it could be disabled too.

### Disabling mesh-wide Egress passthrough to external destinations

Similar to enabling egress, mesh-wide egress can be disabled during FSM install or post install.

1. During FSM install:

   ```bash
   fsm install --set fsm.enableEgress=false
   ```

2. After FSM has been installed:
   Use `kubectl patch` to set `enableEgress` to `false` in the `fsm-mesh-config` resource.
   ```bash
   # Replace fsm-system with the namespace where FSM is installed
   kubectl patch meshconfig fsm-mesh-config -n fsm-system -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"enableEgress":false}}}'  --type=merge
   ```

With egress disabled, traffic from pods within the mesh will not be able to access external services outside the cluster.

### How it works

When egress is enabled mesh-wide, FSM controller programs every Pipy proxy sidecar in the mesh with a wildcard rule that matches outbound destinations that do not correspond to in-mesh services. The wildcard rule that matches such external traffic simply proxies the traffic as is to its original destination without subjecting them to L4 or L7 traffic policies.

FSM supports egress for traffic that uses TCP as the underlying transport. This includes raw TCP traffic, HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC etc.

Since mesh-wide egress is a global setting and operates as a passthrough to unknown destinations, fine grained access control (such as applying TCP or HTTP routing policies) over egress traffic is not possible.

Refer to the [Egress passthrough demo](/demos/egress/egress_passthrough) to learn more.

#### Pipy configurations

When egress is enabled globally in the mesh, the FSM controller issues the following configuration for each Pipy proxy sidecar.

```json
{
  "Spec": {
    "SidecarLogLevel": "error",
    "Traffic": {
      "EnableEgress": true
    }
  }
}
```

The Pipy script for `EnableEgress=true` will use the original destination logic to route the request to proxy it to the original destination.
